## Talk description
This presentation describes how fuzzing is leveraged in the Mozilla development workflow for the JavaScript engine in 2017.

It will mention how you can use it in your workflow to make development more efficient, and will not cover fuzzing itself in detail.

## Abstract
In Mozilla Firefox, the JavaScript engine (SpiderMonkey) is an important component of the Gecko platform.

In this presentation, Senior Security Engineer Gary Kwong will describe how fuzzing is leveraged in the Mozilla development workflow for the JavaScript engine.

He will talk about various fuzzing tools (e.g. jsfunfuzz) for such engines. The potential pitfalls of this approach and conditions under which fuzzing can be most effective will also be discussed.

Finally, he will touch on some future plans for these tools.
