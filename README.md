## Talk description
This presentation describes where fuzzing sits in a Mozilla development workflow in 2016 (originally for 2015).

It will mention how you can leverage it in your workflow to make development more efficient, and will not cover fuzzing itself in detail.

## Abstract
The Mozilla Gecko platform has many moving parts. With the move into Firefox OS, there are increasingly more areas which need testing to ensure good quality and safety of the users.

In this presentation, Senior Security Engineer Gary Kwong will describe how fuzzing can be leveraged in the Mozilla development workflow. Gary will talk about fuzzing tools, suggested automation building blocks and ways to start deploying fuzzing quickly.

A case study on the success of the fuzzing team working together with the JavaScript team will be described. Furthermore, he will also cover the potential pitfalls of this approach and conditions under which fuzzing can be most effective.
